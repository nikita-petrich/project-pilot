name: complete
description: Wrap up a finished feature or fix. Archives its spec to blueprint/history/features/ (feature) or blueprint/history/fixes/ (fix), checks features off the build plan, resets blueprint/context/current-feature.md to its stub, makes one feature-level commit, then squash-merges the branch to main and deletes it. Merges only with explicit approval, then asks separately before pushing main. Use when the user runs /complete, or asks to finish, wrap up, merge, or close out the current feature or fix after it's built and reviewed.

# complete - log the finished work, make the feature commit, and merge

Where this sits in the workflow:

    /feature or /fix  ->  /implement  ->  [complete]  ->  next
    (the spec)            (build it)      (commit + merge + log)

`/implement` built the feature or fix on its branch, with optional per-step commit
checkpoints. This skill closes it out: it logs the work, makes the single
feature-level commit, and squash-merges. Run it only when the build is done,
reviewed, and the build and tests pass.

## Before you start

Confirm the work is actually finished: `blueprint/context/current-feature.md` holds a real
spec, its steps are built on a branch, and the build and tests pass. If any of the
spec's done-whens are behavioral, `/check` should have proven them against the
running app first - don't merge on an unverified claim. Uncommitted step work is
expected (per-step checkpoints are optional); this skill commits it. Don't require
the steps to be pre-committed.

## Step 1 - log the work

Check whether the spec is a feature or a fix (a fix is marked `Type: Fix` and has
no build-plan number).

- **Feature** - archive `blueprint/context/current-feature.md` to `blueprint/history/features/NN-name.md`
  (NN is the build-plan number), and check it off in `blueprint/build-plan.md`
  (and its parent item once all sub-items are checked).
- **Fix** - archive it to `blueprint/history/fixes/name.md`. A fix isn't a build-plan item, so
  there's nothing to check off.

Then reset `blueprint/context/current-feature.md` to its stub ("nothing in progress"). Don't
commit yet; the next step makes one feature commit covering the code and these doc
changes. The archive is the build history.

**Discard consumed prototypes.** If this feature built the look from `prototypes/`
- its Design reference pointed there and an early step ported `prototypes/theme.css`
into the app - delete the `prototypes/` folder now. The tokens live in the real
stylesheet and the HTML mockups were always throwaway; fold the deletion into this
feature's commit. Skip this if the feature didn't consume prototypes.

## Step 2 - make the feature commit

Stage everything on the branch (any uncommitted step work plus the Step 1 logging
changes) and make one conventional feature commit (for example `feat: <feature>`
or `fix: <name>`). Build and tests must pass first.

## Step 3 - merge

1. Squash-merge the branch into main, only with the user's explicit go-ahead, so
   the feature lands as one clean commit regardless of how many checkpoints the
   branch carried.
2. Delete the branch after a clean merge.
3. Stop and ask whether to push local `main` to its upstream. The merge approval
   does not count as push approval.
4. Push main only after a separate explicit yes to push main in the current chat.
   If the repo has no remote or upstream, say so instead of guessing.

Then point the user at `/feature` (or `/fix`) for the next thing.

Finish with a concise **How to try it** note for the completed feature. If the
manual path is more than a couple of steps, tell the user to run `/try latest`;
that command can read the archived feature after `current-feature.md` is reset.

## Rules

- The feature is the unit of history: one squashed feature commit on main, even if
  the branch carried several checkpoint commits.
- Don't merge unfinished or failing work; the build and tests must pass first.
- Merging and pushing are the user's calls: get an explicit yes for the merge,
  then ask whether to push main. Do not treat merge approval, `/complete`, or
  "looks good" as permission to push.
- Push main only after a separate explicit yes to push main in the current chat.
- One item per completion. If a parent feature still has unchecked sub-features,
  leave the parent unchecked.

## Formatting

Format the output to match the project's conventions in
`blueprint/context/ai-interaction.md`: concise, scannable markdown, with lists for
enumerations and tables for matrices rather than dense paragraphs.
