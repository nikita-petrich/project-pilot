# Build Plan

> One of the two planning docs you provide. Write it yourself or with the AI's help.

The features that make up this project, high level and in rough build order, one
line each, no detail (that comes per feature). Rough is fine at first, but before
`/overview` runs this file should be shaped into a checkbox list the build loop
can track.

Keep it as a checklist. Run `/feature` with no number to spec the **next
unchecked** item, or `/feature 3` / `/feature "login"` to pick a specific one.
Completed features get checked off here, so the build plan doubles as your
progress tracker. A big item gets split into sub-items (4a, 4b, etc.) when you
spec it.

Scaffolding the app (create-next-app, etc.) and prototyping the look are
pre-build steps, not features (see the README), so don't list them here. Start
with your first real slice of functionality.

A common order that works well: build the core UI with placeholder data first,
then wire up data, auth, and integrations, and deploy once it's worth shipping.
Adapt it to your project.

## Format

Use checkboxes. Each item should be a feature-sized outcome, not a loose task or
a whole product area.

Good:

- [ ] 1. **Skill submission** - upload a skill package and save its metadata
- [ ] 2. **Validation result** - run checks and show pass/fail status for a skill
- [ ] 3. **Directory listing** - browse and filter published skills

Avoid:

- Upload stuff
- Database
- Make it look nice
- Auth, billing, dashboard, validation, and deploy

If your first pass is just rough bullets, that is okay. Run `/overview` after
filling both planning docs; it will flag plan-shape problems and can propose a
cleaned-up checkbox version before generating the project overview.

- [ ] 1. **Feature one** - description
- [ ] 2. **Feature two** - description
